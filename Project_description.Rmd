The CyVerse NEON Browser is a multifunctional R Shiny tool designed to make NEON data accessible, visible, and easy to interact with. Commissioned by the <a href='https://www.cyverse.org/' target='_blank'>CyVerse</a> initiative, this application attempts to highlight the best of <a href='https://www.neonscience.org/' target='_blank'>NEON</a> and improve its user experience. By combining the <a href='https://shiny.rstudio.com/' target='_blank'>R Shiny</a> platform, community resources, and NEON's services, this project brings together the essential parts of NEON into one multifaceted tool.

### Origin

As an academic organization that promotes data-driven discovery and provides public cyberinfrastructure to scientists, NEON and this project fall squarely within CyVerse's mission. Attempting to further advance NEON's community-based philosophy, the CyVerse NEON Browser was one of the first apps to be unveiled on CyVerse's Interactive Discovery Environment (VICE), which hosts scientitic applications publically to make them more accessible. The app, which deals with purely NEON, actually traces its origin back to the project "Calliope View" which displays drone imaging aloneside ecological data (hence, NEON). Throughout the developement of Calliope View, we realized that the features implemented to display and pull NEON data were very useful, and as a result we created this stand-alone tool.

### Creation

This application pulls heavily from existing resources developed across the NEON and data science communities. As Tyson Swetnam (the leader of this project) stated, it took an "epic amount of labor" from NEON to collect their data and create their Data API, and just as much work from the RShiny community to provide hundreds of thousands of lines of pre-written code. For example, this application rests on the R language and the R Shiny framework, and uses a multitude of packages to aid the maps, layouts, and downloads found inside. Specifically, the interactive map is created by <a href='https://leafletjs.com/' target='_blank'>leaflet</a> (<a href='https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/' target='_blank'>for R</a>), with its contents and geometries coming from NEON's API and spatial resources. The Data Browser combines <a href='https://github.com/ropensci/nneo' target='_blank'>nneo</a>, a community package, and <a href='https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities' target='_blank'>NEON Utilities</a>, a tool developed by NEON itself, to bring the product catalog and options to download. By connecting all of these aspects into one platform, users who may not be familiar with R or Rstudio can reap all of the advantages that it offers in terms of accessing NEON data.
