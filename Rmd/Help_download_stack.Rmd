As explained in the previous step, stacking is a very useful step that can make NEON data more understandable. This will occur after a product download, in the step labeled `Stack`.

Every data product from the `Download` step will come in a folder. To stack that product, first use the widget (click on the `...` button) to select the folder with the download; then click `Stack Data` to stack it. If the folder isn't stacked yet, it should be filled with zip files (one for each month of the product). If it already has been, there should be a folder named `stackedFiles` with the data in it.

After data is stacked, it is in its final form, ready to be used for analyses.
