## NEON

The [National Ecological Observatory Network](https://www.neonscience.org/), funded by the United States National Science Foundation](https://nsf.gov) and operated by [Battelle Inc.](https://www.battelle.org/,) is a continental-scale project that provides open data to the global scientific community. The envisioned 30-year observatory collects environmental data, e.g. precipitation, air and soil temperature, vegetation health, species diversity and composition across 81 field sites (47 terrestrial and 34 aquatic). NEON data provide the ability to measure pattern and change in our environment at an unprecedented scale. With over 180 data products describing the characteristics of a diverse range of ecosystems, their data will be crucial to future studies of biology and climate change over time.
