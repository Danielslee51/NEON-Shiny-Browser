##### Obtain a data product in its entirety

Download NEON data products from one site without filtering over time. A product ID from the Product Catalog or the NEON <a href='http://data.neonscience.org/static/browse.html' target='_blank'>data portal</a> is required.

The downloads will appear in a new folder of the form **NEON\_\<site\>\_\<product ID\>**, located in the **NEON Downloads** folder. These items are zipped and need to be put through step 2.
