##### Obtain a data product in its entirety

Download NEON data products without filtering over time or location (although location can be filtered). This functionality requires a product ID from step 1 or the NEON <a href='http://data.neonscience.org/static/browse.html' target='_blank'>data portal</a>. Optionally, one NEON site can be selected.

The downloads will appear in a new folder of the form **NEON\_\<site\>\_\<product ID\>**, located in the **NEON Downloads** folder. These items are zipped and need to be put through step 2.
